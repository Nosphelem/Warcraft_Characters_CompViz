# Warcraft Character Identification Model
Here is my student project, a trained model meant to recognize characters from the Warcraft Universe. Actually, he is able to identify 4 of them for the moment but I keep working on it, to add some more of them.

### -- MOTIVATION
As an IT student, I am very interested in computer vision technologies. That's why I built my firt model, to learn what it's all about and more importantly : how it works. That's not much, but I guess I'm on my way to improve my skill.

### -- BUILD STATUS 
I am continuously working on this project, among osme others, so I'll be updating it as often as I can.

### -- TECH/FRAMEWORK USED
Because of the computing power needed for this kind of technology, I worked on it by using Google Collab. The AI model used is ResNet34.

### -- INSTALLATION
The more convinient way to use this model is to import it on a new Google Collab project. You can run it immediatly, the only thing you'll have to do manually is to import the .csv files stored in the "Data" folder in the Google Collab online directory. 
(Your files are supposed to be in the /content/data/characters/... directories)

### -- TRIBUTES
The things on this project were learned from the FastAI online courses (https://www.fast.ai) under the supervision of my teacher M. DALLARD Benjamin (https://github.com/bdallard?tab=repositories).
